In the middle of hustling and bustling, chaos, and irregularities, the streets thrive. Empty streets are as useless as a camera without storage. The streets carry with them the randomness of every day along with the scars of history. Go out on the streets and bring a photo that shows “Streets” and stand a chance to win exciting prizes.

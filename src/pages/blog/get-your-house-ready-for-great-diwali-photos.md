Once you have managed to be on-spot with the decoration, everything else falls in place. Taking social media apt photographs after that is a piece of cakewalk. If by now you are scratching your head about nailing the decoration, we are here to help. We bring to you a bunch of easy and unique ideas to get your house ready for Diwali and great Diwali photos.

**DIY Photo-booth at Home**

Decorate your home by setting up a photo-booth at your house entrance or any other corner you like. You can use coloured chart papers or a coloured bed sheet/dupatta as backdrop of the booth.

Attach some fairy lights around the border to make it look even more beautiful. You can even hang flower strings on the backdrop to give it a festive look. And viola! Your photo-booth is ready for clicking great pictures.

**DIY Paper Cup Lights**

This is of the easiest Diwali DIYs, and it makes for one of the finest backgrounds. For this, you can use a few colourful paper cups and attach them together with a thread by making a hole in the middle.

Now wrap any colour fairy light around the thread and the cups and hang the whole string on the wall. You can keep the length as much as you want. You can even hang these paper cup lights in the balcony or on the terrace. These lights will give a dreamy look to the photos clicked at night.

**Diwali Food Aesthetic Flat Lays**

This is a Diwali must! Share the yummy delicacies with your community by clicking their pictures. Create a little setup by placing the delicacies and Diwali sweets.

A great flat lay photograph is a bird's eye perception of the spread below. Hence it is important to pay attention to the organisation. You can follow the following tips for a great flat lay photograph.

1. Create a foodie spread that has more than one dish in it. Pick a hero piece that you'll focus on.

2. Compose the placement in a way that it covers the frame. Arrange the food around the hero dish. Make sure to keep ample negative space while preparing the composition.

3. Decide the composition in a way that it adds multitude of colour to the photograph. Instead of playing with the food colour, you can also use a contrasting background. An easy way to do this is to arrange the dishes on a chess board.

4. Be realistic with the choice of background. It is not required to have a solid chart paper as the backdrop to have a beautiful flat lay result.

Paper lanterns are a vibe. We all learned how to make these pretty little lanterns from craft paper back at school. And what better time to use these learnings, if not on Diwali.

You can cut the paper in different designs and shapes and put fake candles or fairy lights inside them. Hang them on the wall or at the entrance and click some amazing pictures with it.

**Bottle and Glass Lights**

Have some spare empty bottles, jars and wine glasses lying around? This Diwali, use them to make DIY lights.

Take an empty bottle or a jar, clean it and dry it thoroughly. Once you have prepped it, add some cotton balls and fairy light to it. You can also use colourful stones before putting in the lights. Place the bottles and glasses around the house or in any one corner that you like. They will light up the house and will act as great props for your Diwali photos.

**DIY Paper Garlands**

Make your own floral garlands by using tissues and coloured sheets. It's fairly easy to make. All you have got to do is fold the tissues in a way to make a flower and sprinkle some glitter on it.

Attach the tissue flowers together through a string and use it to decorate your home.

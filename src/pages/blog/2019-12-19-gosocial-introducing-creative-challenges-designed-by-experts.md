There are many ways to learn a creative skill on the Internet. It can be through a professional course, watching youtube videos or hustling on the Internet to find relevant resources. This is a great path to learning but research suggests that there is one problem, the dropout rate in online courses is between 40% to as high as 80% ([B. Smith, 2010, E-learning Technologies](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2158244015621777)). People lose the motivation, discipline on the way and often there is no fun element in learning in isolation. 

Our team at GoSocial went through an intensive brainstorming to understand what factors contribute to creative learning. And how we can reimagine and add to the experience of learning online by creating something fun, engaging, and useful.

**The findings at our end was that the lifecycle as a creator goes through the following steps, explained with an example of photography:**

## Discovery

This is a stage where a person starts taking conscious interest in a creative skill like photography, they expose themselves to different works and forms of photography. If the triggers add up and the person goes on to develop a consistent Interest, they are ready for the next stage. 

## Learning

Learning is a cycle that Involves exploration, creation and inspiration. A person explores the world of photography,  gets ideas, goes on to take pictures, explores more, gets inspiration from professional photographers, learn the tools and skills to upscale her creativity. 

## Validation

This is one of the most important steps in the creative journey where a person discovers if she belongs, does her work gets appreciation, can she call herself a photographer. At this stage, even a single positive comment from a competent person can boost her confidence by leaps and bounds. Projects, rewards, feedback, small earnings, winning a contest, appreciation and being part of a photography community, all of this adds to her validation. 

## Professionalism

Once she is validated as a photographer she goes on further to establish herself as a professional. This is where her skill can contribute to real world projects and enable her to earn. After spending a substantial amount of time as a professional some of them start giving back to the community through mentoring, guidance and inspiration.

Once we identified this journey, the target was to bring it to life in the form of a the GoSocial App.  

The core idea that emerged was to keep creators in action and provide them with a framework that keeps creation at the centre - "Learning By Doing". At the same time fulfils all the other requirements of the creative journey like validation, feedback and guidance. 

With this approach we came up with the concept of creative challenges - carefully designed by experts. These challenges should be able to give creative enthusiasts hands on prompts to up-skill themselves with opportunities for expert guidance, a community and a method to gain validation, where rewards come into play. 

This quote by Albert Einstein sums up this approach -

> “I never teach my pupils; I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn’’ - Albert Einstein

Challenges provide conditions in which a creator can learn by being in the action. Along with learning, the experience also focuses on collaboration, feedback, and validation through rewards.

  Photography contests and giveaways are fun, but the entire process of hosting
  it, collecting entries, and distributing prizes involve a dozen variables. At
  GoSocial, we've trimmed it down to two steps for you: Create a contest and
  announce the winning entries. And we manage everything that's in between.

GoSocial can mean many things for many people. But at the core, it enables action and engagement for creators.

We figured out that for the extra-curricular clubs in the colleges, people who want to host giveaway contests, and brands that are trying to engage people around causes can make use of the contest feature.

By opening up the contests for all, we are bringing a greater level. 

Here's how it works:

1. Share the details of the contest you want to run by [filling this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpQMrSBtd97YckLdNOFBrFqo-APlkGjfZOWZbiI3Ms3ucbHw/viewform?usp=sf_link) and we'll get in touch with shortly.

2. Once we mutually finalize the contest theme, dates, duration, and prizes, we'll host the contest on the GoSocial App.

3. That's all. Now you can bring your college club members, followers, and friends to participate in your contest.

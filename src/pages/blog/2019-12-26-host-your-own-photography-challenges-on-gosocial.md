By creating photography challenges on GoSocial, you can help photographers in learning, establish a new method to engage with your followers, and also host a giveaways. These personal challenges not only helps people in improving but also keeps them going with their hobby.

## **Creating challenges**

We are onboarding photographers who actively help other to learn and get into the domain by sharing their knowledge. The goal is to create streak based photography challenges/projects.

There could be two types of streaks based challenges:

\- Same task on all days such as 5 Days Nature Photography Challenge with same task description for each day\
- Different tasks on all days for example 5 Days Street Photography Challenge with unique task description for each day:

For example, a street photography challenge created by photographer Eric Kim in one of his articles has the following challenges for 5 Days:

\- **Day 1:** The 1-arm-length challenge

\- **Day 2:** The 5 “yes”, 5 “no” challenge

\- **Day 3:** The “telephone pole” challenge

\- **Day 4:** The “no overlap” challenge

\- **Day 5:** Edges in perspective challenge



GoSocial is designed in a way that users can take streak based challenges, post their photos on each day and maintain the streak. Users earn points on successfully completing a streak through which they have a chance to get camera accessories, goodies, and Amazon gift vouchers.

## **Requirements from experts**

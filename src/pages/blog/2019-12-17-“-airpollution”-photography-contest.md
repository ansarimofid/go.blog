We believe that the first step in solving a silent crisis is “Awareness”. So we urge you to gear up with your cameras and devices and capture the most heart-wrenching scenes of Air Pollution in India. And what it looks like to live in a dystopia.

**Participate in this contest to plant a tree:**

We are pledging to plant a tree for each participating entry. Spread the word.
